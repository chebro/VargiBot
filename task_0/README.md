# Task 0

Use the `turtlesim` module to make the turtle complete one circle. Used `ROS Topics`, to publish `Twist` messages to `/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic to control the turtle velocity, and subscribed to `/turtle1/pose` topic to get the close to real time position of the turtle and used `Pose` messages to stop the turtle after revolving an angle of `2 * pi` radians.
